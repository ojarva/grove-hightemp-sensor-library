This is a library for Seeedstudio's Grove - High Temperature Sensor.

Thermocouples are very sensitive, requiring a good amplifier with a temeprature-compensation reference. The Grove High Temperature Sensor uses a K-type thermocouple sensor with a thermistor for temperature compensation. Range for seeedstudio's K-type thermocouple is -50-600℃, with accuracy of ±(2.0% + 2℃).
